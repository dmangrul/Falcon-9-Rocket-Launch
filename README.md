# Falcon-9-Rocket-Launch
This program is a computer file that displays a simulation of rocket launches using real-life data and outputs real information about each rocket (Falcon 9, Saturn V) with Java Graphics and JPanel. This project Integrated graphics by displaying launch and manipulating background and rocket features over timeâ€”printing numeric values to track data. The program calculated real-life instant values with physics equations involving kinematics and universal gravitation. The project contains Java and implements libraries such as Graphics, ActionListener and ActionEvent, Timer, and BufferedImage
